How to administer the Sequence Test (9-23-18)
=============================================

(1) Run the task 

Navigate to the “seqtest/” folder and execute seqtest.exe.


(2) Enter subject ID

Enter the subject’s ID, which will be recorded on their results file. Wait until you have explained the task before pressing “Enter,” which will start the task immediately.


(3) Explain the task

Say: “This is the sequencing game. When we start, you will see six mixed up cards across the bottom of the screen. Your job is to put them in what you think is the most logical order in the six empty spaces at the top of the screen. You can move a card by clicking on it once to pick it up, and clicking again on the space where you want to place the card. Not by clicking and dragging, but by clicking once to pick up, and again to put down.  You can place a card in an empty space or one with another card; if the space is full, you will pick up the card that had been there previously. When you are satisfied that the cards are in what you think is the most logical order, press the spacebar to finish the round. Any questions?”


(4) Start the task

If the subject is satisfied that they understand the instructions, press “Enter” to begin the first round. 

Make sure that the subject presses [space] to indicate when they are done with the first round. After the first round, explain that they can click anywhere on the screen to advance to the next one.


(5) During the task

If you need to end a round early for any reason, you can force advance by pressing [shift] + [.] (the forward arrow).  


(6) End the task

Once the subject has completed every round, a game over screen will appear. Press [escape] to end the task.


(7) Results

Results will be saved in the folder “seqtest/results/” as a text file named: subjectID_date_time.csv. Partial results will be saved if the experiment is aborted before all rounds have been completed.
