How to administer the Sequence Test (9-23-18)
=============================================

The task should take about 15-20 minutes to administer.

(1) Run the task 

Navigate to the “seqtest/” folder and execute seqtest.exe.


(2) Enter subject ID

Enter the subject’s ID, which will be recorded on their results file. Wait until you have explained the task before pressing “Enter,” which will start the task immediately.


(3) Explain the task

Say: “This is the sequencing game. When we start, you will see six mixed up cards across the bottom of the screen. Your job is to put them in what you think is the most logical order in the six empty spaces at the top of the screen, from left to right. You can move a card by clicking on it once to pick it up, and then clicking on the space where you want to place the card. Not by clicking and dragging, but by clicking once to pick up, and again to put down. Does that make sense? [Make sure the subject understands the controls. If they still don’t after you explain them again, you can correct them during the control round.]. You can place a card in an empty space or one with another card; if the space is full, you will pick up the card that had been there previously. When you are satisfied that the cards are in what you think is the most logical order, press the return key [point to the return key] to finish the round. Any questions?”
(Explanatory note: the mouse controls are designed to be as easy as possible for subjects who are motor-impaired. They can be counterintuitive for some subjects, who expect to be able to click and drag.)


(4) Start the task

If the subject is satisfied that they understand the instructions, press [return] to begin the first round. 
Make sure that the subject presses [return] to indicate when they are done with the first round. If they did not use a correct sequence (1-2-3-4-5 or 6-5-4-3-2-1), tell them what would have been correct. If the subject appeared to not fully remember or understand any of the instructions (e.g., if they attempted to drag and drop the cards), remind or re-instruct them.  After the first round, explain that they can click anywhere on the screen to advance to the next one.


(5) During the task

If you need to end a round early or skip a round for any reason, you can force advance by pressing [shift] + [.].
Each round will time out automatically after 240 seconds. 
In order to keep the task to a reasonable length, follow these rules for skipping rounds:
(a)	If the subject times out on the first two rounds of a given type (e.g., verbal), skip the third round. 
(b)	If the subject times out on the first two rounds of the first two types (verbal and spatial), skip all rounds of the third type (cartoon). 

(5.1) Tally unintentional moves
During each round, make a note every time the subject makes a move that is clearly accidental. Use the document “tally_unintentional_moves.pdf”, which includes more detailed instructions and examples.
(Explanatory note: This procedure is intended to mitigate the possibility that subjects who are motor-impaired might have artificially lower scores because of difficulty with the controls.)



(6) End the task

Once the subject has completed every round, a game over screen will appear. Press [escape] to end the task.


(7) Results

Results will be saved in the folder “seqtest/results/” as a text file named: subjectID_date_time.csv. Partial results will be saved if the experiment is aborted before all rounds have been completed. If the subject timed out on a round or the round was force advnaced before all six cards were placed, no score will be recorded. 

(7.1) Manually add unintentional moves tallies to results
Save a copy of the original .csv file in a dedicated folder. Then, open the .csv file in a text editor to add the subject’s unintentional moves. Add two columns to the end of the first row: “NonMoves” and “CorMoves.” Make sure they are separated with commas, following the format of the other headers.  For each round, record the total number of unintentional moves under “NonMoves,” and record the corrected number of moves (Moves – NonMoves) as CorMoves. 

(7.2) Correct control score if needed
On the control condition only, the order 6-5-4-3-2-1 is correct. If the subject used this order, change their score from “0.0” to “1.0”.
